Offshore wind has emerged as a vital component of the U.S. energy transition. Its potential to deliver large-scale renewable electricity while minimizing land-use conflicts makes it especially attractive. Yet in recent years, the sector has faced growing political and social scrutiny, including public backlash and regulatory pushback influenced by disinformation, economic concerns, and environmental ambiguity. Notably, political rhetoric during the Trump administration, and its ongoing ripple effects, have cast doubt on offshore wind’s environmental impacts—particularly on marine ecosystems and fishing communities—fueling controversy in regions critical to deployment.
This project tackles the question: What does it mean for an offshore wind developer to achieve No Net Loss (NNL) or even a Net Positive Impact (NPI) on biodiversity? Engaged by Attentive Energy, our team has investigated how NNL and NPI can be clarified and applied by state regulators to guide environmentally responsible offshore wind development.
By drawing on both domestic and international policies, practices, and stakeholder interviews, this Capstone project delivered actionable guidance that bridges scientific insight and regulatory practice. Our short-term policy recommendations, such as defining biodiversity and clear goals around NNL / NPI, are grounded in leading frameworks such as the UK Environmental Act, the IUCN Review Protocol for Biodiversity Net Gain, and IFC Performance Standard 6. Case studies such as offshore wind development in the Netherlands inform our long-term recommendations, including investing in further research and local community engagement.
